# **Introduction**  
  

Welcome to the documentation for HarryscarsDB, a database created as the final assignment for my SQL course.  
This database is written in T-SQL using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).  
The example data was generated by ChatGPT and adjusted by me for testing purposes.

Had this project been integrated with a front end and a connected domain, certain design choices would have been different.

Thank you for taking the time to explore this project!
